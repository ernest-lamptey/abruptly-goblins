# Abruptly Goblins
## About
- This program takes a dictionary of gamers and what they are available to play games. With this information, the program chooses a game night based on how many people are available and then also chooses a second day for those who missed the first game because they were unavailable. It also generates an email message customized for each gamer.

## Platform
Jupyter Notebooks

## Comments
- I learnt a lot about dictionaries while completing this project. I find that I appreciate the projects more than when I started. It isn't too much of a chore now and I think it's the perfect thing to strengthen my understanding of these concepts
- Overall the project wasn't too difficult like the Vigenere Cipher :joy:
- This project is part of my Codecademy Back End Career Path Projects.
